# FYS4150 Project 1 Group number:66
##### For this project we produced seperate program files for each question. Pyhton files have to be run in the same folder as our data file. Python/Matlab files were used to plot the txt output, and any images of these plots are located in the same directory. Do not run the c++ files without deleting the txt files, as it will cause the existing txt files to have repeating data.
